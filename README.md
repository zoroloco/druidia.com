Update - 9/22/2015 - This is the PHP code for the old druidia.com that no longer exists.


Basic PHP site where you can log-in, register user, post comments, etc.

1.) Run the script in your database for the user , board tables, etc.
2.) Change index.php's cookie references to your own site.
3.) DatabaseHandler should have your own database connection info.
